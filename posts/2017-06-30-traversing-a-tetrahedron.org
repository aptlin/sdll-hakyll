* Problem

Suppose you operate a fancy drone inside a mysterious pyramid your
friends have dug out recently. This pyramid is uniquely shaped as a
perfect tetrahedron with a side $a$. What is the minimum distance
required to visit each side and return to the starting point?

* Analysis

Let's introduce some notation to make our analysis easier and denote
our tetrahedron as $ABCD$. Suppose that the drone visited all the
sides and returned to the starting point. Without loss of generality,
since the pyramid is mysteriously perfect, we may assume that the
sides were visited in the succession from $ABC$ to $BCD$, from $BCD$
to $DAB$, and from $DAB$ to $ACD$. We will mark the points at which
the drone visited the side as $E, F, G, H$ respectively. We are given
that the minimum distance the drone must traverse is the perimeter of
the spatial quadrilateral $EFGH$. See the figure below.

Construct a plane perpendicular to $AB$ through $DC$. Let the point of
intersection of this plane with $AB$ be denoted as $T$. Note that this
plane is a plane of symmetry for our tetrahedron. Now, reflect the
points of $EFGH$ through the constructed plane to obtain a
quadrilateral $E_1F_1G_1H_1$. Notice that the point $E_1$ will be on
the side $ABC$, just as a /parent/ point $E$. The situation is similar
with the points $G_1$ and $G$, both on the side $DAB$. $F_1$, however,
will fall on the side $ACD$, on which the point $H$ is located, and
$H_1$ will fall on the side $BCD$, containing $F$. Since the
constructed plane is a mirror plane, perimeters of $EFGH$ and
$E_1F_1G_1H_1$ are equal.

To proceed, we prove a handy lemma.

Consider an arbitrary spatial quadrilateral $KLMN$. Let $P$ and $Q$ be
the points of $KL$ and $MN$ respectively. Then $PQ \leq \frac{1}{2}
(KN+LM)$.

The lemma is depicted below.

#+END_EXPORT

Let $R$ mark the midpoint of a diagonal $LN$. Since $PR=\frac{1}{2}KN$
and $RQ=\frac{1}{2}LM$ from the similarity of corresponding triangles,
by the triangle inequality we know that $PQ \leq PR + RQ$, which
proves the lemma.

Now, let $E_2, F_2, G_2, H_2$ be the midpoints of the segments $EE_1$,
$FH_1$, $GG_1$, and $HF_1$ respectively. Vertices of the quadrilateral
$E_2F_2G_2H_2$ also lie on the sides of the tetrahedron. The perimeter
of $E_2F_2G_2H_2$ is less than the perimeter of $EFGH$, as follows
from our lemma. To convince yourself, see the figure below:

#+END_EXPORT

Moreover, the points $E_2$ and $G_2$, which are midpoints of $EE_1$
and $GG_1$ respectively, are going to belong to the plane of symmetry
$TCD$ we have constructed earlier. Notice that $CT$ and $DT$ are
medians of the sides $ABC$ and $ABD$.

Now, mirror the quadrilateral $E_2F_2G_2H_2$ in the plane $ABS$, where
$S$ is the midpoint of $CD$, to obtain $E_3F_3G_3H_3$, and then,
taking the midpoints of the segments defined by the points of
$E_2F_2G_2H_2$ and $E_3F_3G_3H_3$ sharing the same side, construct the
quadrilateral $E_4F_4G_4H_4$. Consult the diagram below:

<img style="width: 50%;float:right;margin:-20px; margin-right:5px; margin-left:0px;" src="../files/assets/posts/tt/medians.jpg">
#+END_EXPORT

This quadrilateral is special in the following sense: $E_4$ and $G_4$
belong to the segments $CT$ and $DT$, while vertices $F_4$ and $H_4$
lie on the medians $AS$ and $BS$ of the sides $ACD$ and $BCD$, as seen
in the figure:

#+END_EXPORT

Similarly, the perimeter of $E_4F_4G_4H_4$ is not bigger than the
perimeter of $EFGH$. Therefore, the perimeter of $EFGH$ is not less
than $4d$, where $d$ is the distance between the lines $CT$ and $BS$.

All we need to do now is to find a path of length $4d$ and compute $d$.

Let $E_0F_0$ denote the line perpendicular both to $CT$ and $BS$, with
$E_0$ belonging to $CT$, and $F_0$ lying on $BS$. Let $G_0$ be a point
symmetric to $E_0$ with regards to the plane $ABS$. From symmetry in
the plane $ABS$ we can deduce that $F_0G_0$ is a common perpendicular
of $BS$ and $DT$. 

Proceeding in a similar way, we construct a point $H_0$, such that
$G_0H_0$ and $H_0E_0$ are common perpendiculars of $DT$ and $AS$, and
of $AS$ and $CT$ respectively.

#+END_EXPORT

The quadrilateral $E_0F_0G_0H_0$ has a perimeter of $4d$. We need to
make sure, however, that the points of these common perpendiculars lie
on the sides of our tetrahedron, and not on their continuations.
Meanwhile, we will also calculate $d$.

Erect a plane through $AB$ perpendicular to the base $ABC$. Project
our tetrahedron on this plane to obtain a triangle $ABD'$, in which
$AB = a$, $D'T = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}a$, since $D'T$ is the height of a
regular tetrahedron, and $S'$ is the projection of $S$ corresponding
to the middle of $D'T$.

Since $CT$ is perpendicular to $AB$ and thus the common perpendicular
of $CT$ and $BS$ is parallel to the plane of projection, the distance
from the point $T$ to $BS'$ in the triangle $ABD'$ has the length of
exactly $d$. Moreover, since the base of a perpendicular from $T$ to
$BS'$ lies inside $ABD'$ on the segment $BS'$, then $F_0$ belongs to
$BS$ and not to its continuation. Similarly, all the other points of
the quadrilateral can be shown to lie on the medians themselves.

Now, after all the work we have done, it is easy to compute $d$. We
know that $BT = \frac{a}{2}$ and $TS' =
\frac{a}{2}\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}$. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem,
$BS' = \frac{a}{2}\sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}$. 

Now, the area of the triangle $BTS'$ is $\frac{1}{2} BT \cdot TS'$,
and also $\frac{1}{2} d \cdot BS'$, and hence $d = \frac{BT\cdot
TS'}{BS'}$, which means that $d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{10}}$.

* Conclusion and Discussion

Our fancy drone must cover the distance of $\frac{2 \sqrt{10}}{5} a$
to traverse the walls of the mysterious pyramid efficiently. Moreover,
our analysis has also shown that the number of the most efficient
paths is exactly three, for each choice of two planes of the
tetrahedron mirror symmetry. 

We could also ask ourselves an analogous question about a tiny
crawling robot inside a triangle with sides $a, b, c$. What is the
least distance required to visit each side and return to the initial
position? For an acute triangle, this problem is also known as
/Fagnano's problem/.

What can we say about simplices in higher dimensions?
