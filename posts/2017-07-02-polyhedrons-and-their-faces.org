* Problem

Suppose you are sick of the tedious sameness in your surroundings and
decide to enlighten your days with a polyhedron with as many different
faces as possible, but with the least number of edges as well. What
are you going to do?

* Analysis

To begin with, let's think how many unique faces we can have given an
arbitrary convex polyhedron. Take a face with the greatest number of edges,
and suppose that this number is $n$. All the other faces have an edge
count in the range from $3$ to $n$ inclusive. 

By the pigeonhole principle, since there are $(n-3) + 1 = n-2$
possible unique faces, we know that at least two faces have the same
number of edges.

Now, let's find a polyhedron with the least number of edges such that
it has no three faces with the same edge count. 

We cannot make a proper polyhedron with just two triangles and two
rectangles. Do not surrender! Take two pentagons and glue them
together side by side. Then we just need two triangles and two
quadrilaterals to make our polyhedron! In this way we obtain a
tetrahedron with two adjacent corners truncated. 

Can we truncate some other polyhedron? Sure! Let's try and truncate a cube.

In this way, we obtain a figure consisting of two triangles, two
squares, two pentagons and two hexagons.

Can you come up with other examples? Please let me know!

* Finding Relatives

Now, let's think now about a related problem from the Tournament of
Towns 1999-2000.

Suppose you have a polyhedron with $10n$ faces, where $n$ is some
positive integer. How many faces with the same number of edges can you
find?

It seems that these faces-relatives must inflict some limit on the
overall structure of our polyhedron. Let's consider how they affect
angles of the polyhedron.

Take an arbitrary convex polyhedron. How can we estimate its average
exterior angle? Since the polyhedron is convex, all the angles at some
vertex $A$ sum up to less than $2\pi$ (otherwise, we could /flatten
out/ the vertex). Therefore, if there are $k$ angles sharing $A$ as
their endpoint, then the sum of the corresponding exterior angles is
more than $(k-2)\pi$. The average size of an exterior angle at A is
thus $\alpha(A) > \frac{(k-2)\pi}{k} \geq \frac{\pi}{3}$, since $k
\geq 3$, which means that $\alpha(A)$ is greater than $\frac{\pi}{3}$.

Now, assume that there exists some $10n$-hedron with not more than $n$
faces which are triangles, not more than $n$ faces which are
rectangles and so on. Since there are $10n$ faces, the number of edges
is not less than $(3+4+\ldots+12)n = 75n$. The sum of exterior angles
of each face is $2\pi$, so the total sum of the exterior angles is
$20\pi n$. Hence, the average outer angle must be less than
$\frac{20\pi n}{75n} = \frac{4\pi}{15}$, which is less than
$\frac{\pi}{3}$. Hence, we arrive at a contradiction, thus proving
that there exist at least $n$ faces with the same number of edges.

Can you figure out when the same proof works if we replace $10n$ with
$kn$, where $k$ is some positive integer?
