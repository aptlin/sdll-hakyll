I am Sasha Illarionov, and I am a budding mathematician aspiring to
bring rigour to the field of machine learning, while optimising the
efficiency of distributed and decentralised systems.

My primary goal now is to have a solid background in core mathematics,
computer science and programming.

In 2014 my [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheboksary][Cheboksary]] education was extraordinarily diversified at
[[http://www.westminster.org.uk/westminster/][Westminster School]].

In 2016 I embarked on the pure mathematics specialist program at
[[https://umus.github.io/ut-umu][University of Toronto]].
