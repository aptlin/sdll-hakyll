I am Sasha Illarionov, and I am a budding mathematician aspiring to
bring rigour to the field of machine learning. Optimising the
efficiency of distributed and decentralised systems would also be
[[http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/][great]].

My primary goal now is to have a solid background in core mathematics,
computer science and programming.

From 2014 to 2016 my [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheboksary][Cheboksary]] education was extraordinarily diversified at
[[http://www.westminster.org.uk/westminster/][Westminster School]].

In 2016 I embarked on the pure mathematics specialist program at
[[https://umus.github.io/ut-umu][University of Toronto]].

In 2017 I moved to [[https://cs.hse.ru][HSE]] to study [[https://github.com/sdll/michi][applied mathematics & informatics]].

You can see what I am up to on [[https://github.com/sdll][GitHub]].
