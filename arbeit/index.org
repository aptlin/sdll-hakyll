As a joke I said, "What is the purpose of Life?"

"Proof and conjecture, and keep the SF's score low."
<br/>
<br/>
Now, the game with the SF is defined as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
If you do something bad the SF gets at least two points.

<br/>

If you don't do something good which you could
have done, the SF gets at least one point.

<br/>

And if nothing — if you are okay, then no one gets any point.

<br/>
And the aim is to keep the SF's score low.

*** [[https://github.com/sdll/NOTES/blob/master/ARBEIT/MAT/MAT157/20160923MAT157.pdf][20160923MAT157: Pset II]]

    Nonsense: 30.0%

    Bad work.

    1. No need to prove directly that the set given by the described definition
       is a real number. Do the following instead.

      First show that $$\overline{x} \subseteq \alpha$$, as well as
      that $$\alpha \in \{x \in \mathbb{Q}: \overline{x} < \alpha \}$$
      by proving that $$\alpha$$ is a subset of the RHS.

      Secondly, show that all $$x$$ such that $$x \in \mathbb{Q}$$ and $$
      \overline{x} < \alpha$$ must be in $$\alpha$$.

    2. No need to use addition or subtraction in the proof. Follow the
       KISS principle.

       It follows from the definition of < and $$\subset$$ that $$
       \exists x \in \beta: x \notin \alpha $$. If
       $$\alpha\in\mathbb{Q}: \alpha=\overline{z}$$, it can be that
       $$x = z$$. Then use the fact that $$\beta$$ is real. In either
       case, by Q1, $$\alpha < \overline{x} < \beta$$.

    3. Use Q2 and be careful not to make a typo.

    4. Badly written.

    5. Bad statement of the theorem.

       Hence no full understanding of what its meaning and
       significance theorem is.

       Consider $$\overline{x}$$ for $$x\in\mathbb{Q}$$. Prove that $$x$$
       is the lub of $$\overline{x}$$.

       Suppose that the lub of some real number is $$x$$. Get the
       contradiction by assuming there exists $$y < x$$ and obtain
       that $$\alpha$$ is rational.

    The $$\leftarrow$$ part is wrong, atrocious and disappointing.

    It is obvious that the proof has been written with no intuitive
    understanding of what the linear map given *is*. 

    First, consider $$W=\Im(T), W' = \ker(T)$$. Given some $$v\in V$,
    take $$w=T(v)$$

    Note that $$T(w)=T(T(v))=T(v)=w$$.

    Consider $$w'=v-w$$.

    $$T(w') = T(v)-T(w) = 0$$, and hence $$w'\in\ker(T)$$ and
    $$w'\in W'$$. Therefore, $V=W+W'$.

    Consider now $$w\in W\cap W'$$. Therefore, $$T(w) = w$$, since
    $$w\in W$$, and $$T(w) = 0$$, since $$w\in W'$$. Hence, $$w=0$$,
    and $$V=W\oplus W'$$.

    1. It is true that all square matrices over the field with the
       characteristic not equal to 2 can be written uniquely as a sum
       of a symmetric and a skew-symmetric matrix. Moral: rememember
       that the definitive property of skew-symmetric matrices makes

    The explanation is not lucid, and throwing big-name principles in the

        Order properties tend not to have anything to do with

        *WRONG APPROACH*:

        Suppose that $$W$$ is a subset of $$S$$ to prove by
        contraposition that $$W \cup S$$ is not a subspace of
        $$V$$.

        *It is not necessary that $$W$$ must be a subset of
        $$S$$ if the negation of $$S \subset W$$ is assumed.*

        *BETTER*:

        It is required to show that $$\forall s \in S: s \in W $$. If
        $$s=0$$, the result is trivial. If $$s\neq 0$$, consider $$tv
        \in W\cup S$$ for some scalar $$t$$. Since $$S$$ is finite,
        there exists $$t'$$ such that $$t's \in W\cup S$$, but not in
        $$S$$. Hence, $$t'v \in W$$. Since $$\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{R}$$,
        multiply $$t'v$$ by $$\frac{1}{t'}$$ to get $$v$$, which also
        must be in $$W$$. Hence, all the elements of $$S$$ are in $$W$$.
